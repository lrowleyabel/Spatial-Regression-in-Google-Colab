# Spatial Regression in Google Colab

These are two notebooks used to set up relevant R packages in Google Colab so that it can be used for running spatial regression models. I developed this while conducting spaital regressions on small UK census geographies which took too long to run locally on my machine. I wanted to use Google Colab to run models more quickly, but I found that getting the relevant spatial analysis packages to install and load successfully was difficult. These notebooks set out the succesful workflow I eventually found.
